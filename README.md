# Week 1
Met with Mark Osterman, Manager, Digital Experience as a class at the Lowe Museum. He took us on an excellent tour of the Lowe, giving us a quick overview of the various spaces and the collections. We split up into smaller groups based on a working list of ideas that were provided to us:

**Our next steps included:**
* Interviewing Mark Osterman, Jodi Sypher, and others about the information labels that are presented with each object.
* Interviewing Mark Osterman, Jodi Sypher, and Ebonie Pallock about the opinions and the application of beacon technology in museums.

# Week 2
Nicole, Mackenzie, Deb
We were tasked with presenting ideas about digital labels. We interviewed two people: Mark Osterman, Museum Digital Experience, and Jodi Sypher, Curator and involved with educational experiences. Interview findings:

* Digital labels encourage visitors to learn more, increase the time that visitors spend with each piece, and direct visitors to other parts of the museum

* Content should be layered:
	* Layer 1: Title of piece, artist names(s), etc
	* Layer 2: Historical context
	* Layer 3: Narrative experience

We had mixed answers for which wing of the museum our experience should focus on. Arts of Asia was suggested, as well as a more general approach that included all exhibition wings. Something that we were told to keep in mind was that the Asian, African and Native American pavillions do not have wifi. 

We also came up with design precedents, which included Guide By Cell, 
The Cooper Hewitt Pen, iPad stations, Digital Rail, touch installation walls, multiple touch screens put together, art hotspots and more.

Maria, Zihan, Qinyu:
We interviewed Mark, Jodi, and Ebonie to get a better understanding of what they were trying to achieve by using beacon technology and what current concerns and constraints were. Some interview findings are concluded as follows:

* Goals of the Lowe Art Museum

	* To attract more new visitors and increase returning visitors.
	* To improve visiting experience, further to encourage visitors to slow down as they visit and to make more exploration on each work of art.

* Concerns and Constraints

	* The exhibitions are regularly rotating
	* Visitors are not willing to download an extra app
	* The layout of the museum hinders users from exploration, thus how to navigate visitors through all galleries matters
	* Wi-Fi is not available in all areas

Some design opportunities were identified based on the findings and our research on beacon technology. We also analyzed four design precedents about their pros and cons in order to explore more opportunities about application of beacon technology.

## Ideation
Professor Lien Tran facilitated an ideation exercise with the class and Mark Osterman (Lowe) to brainstorm ideas based on the initial research we did last week. We approached our thinking through the different types of technology across the ideas the Lowe wanted us to explore.

![](ZAct6FTzsiajh7GCXQMRZRUX2rWvAEV-YY_be-3A9s18RBMbyNqg6AYhISmvdNCWSltHysqrX5T3PEGyMeXLlBHNBZQ9HSygaX9jXZmEaH_rGMNKbwHlqXY2CL9lq0JAZOYTBWNQ.png)

## We then explored answering the prompt, “How might we …”
One of the primary goals for the Lowe is to attract more visitors from campus. While the Lowe is integrated into the campus and within proximity to heavy traffic areas, the student population especially rarely visits. 

![](b9_WlWn1P7qWydQv13qhj0RHcj25FulpwPauahEqPcoMFAgYN2mkuN3-xP25zTeFg6n1Sq38_9wuiSQQqRKf2UBqX2BcEGjI7LmYtqDjVlDcKwIio-JyDYqOB0w05KXKnX-GvdwT.jpg)

Based on the exercises, we then split up again, in to four different groups:

1. Magic Leap: “Ghosts”
2. Magic Leap: Treasure Hunt
3. Data Visualization Wall
4. Guerrilla Marketing

# Week 4
After class, we contacted Mark and he put us in touch with Luis to learn more about the API and get an API key. However, we could not figure out how to put the API key in the header of an ajax call since we were not provided the parameter name for the API key. Qinyu and Maria started trying out all possible names like “api-key”, “key”, and “API”, etc but nothing worked.

![](1mA3OICKc8IjA8OQRkaqNrFOHuS-vUrIgpQAhz6_XMWUbsArSk5u6EsgyQTZeLVp2ymhEo1oFamrmHErBoMO_gXMbx2t9iaJK161nsl3NtAbgTuB4dqfKPXKr1U71mXNDDJG_BZT.png)

Maria also tried to connect the server using command lines, still no luck.

![](vsC5CD3fcQCd1aw-kAF8GcX8gZ9-g3csdSoJK4CaUbAozBTAJR5G2rns4GYaJDEIWUjPTT2U6LUhB8TBUd9EJ1bCcizhR6Ejd-Ap54q4zCNGnsZ_Ae93aWLuZfpU98hOzGUKrxD5.png)

Professor Ewing asked UM’s IT Department to create a subdomain (example: labs.interactive.miami.edu) available to our team to host our web page and try to access the API from there. The purpose was to see if a live server would help us with the API.

After some initial testing trying to get the API to work, we realized we needed more information. Qinyu followed up and then Deb sent an email to Luis with specific information about what we needed for the API. Turns out there are at least  [three different APIs](https://apifriends.com/api-creation/different-types-apis/)  — Open (available to the public), Internal and Partner. The eMuseum API is not an open (to the public) API. It is a partner or internal API which means user permissions are required and a specific header call, which we did not have.

During the workshop, Maria and Qinyu worked on figuring out different ways to call the API and pull information. Professor Ewing helped us to upload our website to the Interactive Media FTP from which we tried to submit a POST request to the Lowe’s database. But we kept having issues. While looking at the Lowe’s website in the Collections area, we discovered a JSON link that presented us with a URL we thought we could use to access the database.

Deb and Mackenzie brainstormed categories for the user to interact with and came up with the following list:

![](24udwfwNaSnl8GuXMcubtkiMyDVpon-fQ2lLQubgO4f5VpOPTkzVX1-aIx6qVcbgZQlJBSicp0Vfo43n1ulWK-ZZeaibl79xFuIuK2HsLSazEZYG1sqJ7kVxqpztnXNcdwlJzoXT.png)
![](sUygW9Eil9S2fEFiCJJ8EIOynap-MHRZcXdN7A6zERQ8PqxzsJklySY6OsUVp2HGYUzu2kr2SajtnDlFTCk5BSMVyuQz1K6jNjGY8GxhKXUzR0CSWpFt5kIr4xc2CChlpeq-AU6Z.png)

# Week 5
Mackenzie and Deb worked on creating a design and a v1 prototype. We established a site map (pictured below) and mapped out basic user interactions to inform our prototype.

![](MWFvw3g_iEC7UwJTfepwFrXLK2YdF17WxnM5hnU4dMrqMwFJjNglaI5YXuyOizn7seXUSumshMkywnHOGCAS0Ks758rXhmzTXTcZSQJm9zH0P_gQgEAq0tmlOPrFUgz4rs-p18Nu.png)

Qinyu and Maria worked on problem-solving the API issues we continued to have.
Museum’s IT department sent the following example of Json that they use:
 [https://emuseum1.as.miami.edu/search/silver/objects/json](https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Femuseum1.as.miami.edu%2Fsearch%2Fsilver%2Fobjects%2Fjson&data=02%7C01%7Cdxp785%40miami.edu%7C788990ae4d78455ad32308d7378400d8%7C2a144b72f23942d48c0e6f0f17c48e33%7C0%7C0%7C637038912935396721&sdata=D%2BYC8t3KeDjCTnHPcQ8WLWf0yb6L4KyUQTnSg%2BJYseo%3D&reserved=0) 

During the workshop in class, we added the key that the museum shared with us to the json example as follows:
[https://emuseum1.as.miami.edu/search/silver/objects/json?key=](https://emuseum1.as.miami.edu/search/silver/objects/json?key=9125948a12de679dfb49c1590448ac16b20e3563fb9d6a9d40cd27efcecdbcb9) <key shared with us>

Then, using a Json viewer online ( [http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) ), we were able to see the data as follows:

![](rk-iRC_4PbvFTg6ARplSvodurPLez-8tN-bi9vsdnNxmTmuQt6d-Rm0jvXQZsDkqM6-s7gOaLx6-ApJVx6H5mxuv1i7SU5Fry2S_nhHjkMwu3OT8xWJtCAMmFFUaOUTiDkfj-5Jc.png)

Then, we explored other json links taken from the Lowe Museum art web page to get an idea of how is the structure of the database. Repeating the same procedure of adding the key to the json link and pasting the result in a json viewer, we realized that the data of the Lowe Art Museum is structured as follows:

* Object: Each object of the museum has this information:

	* Creditline
	* Invno
	* Description
	* Medium
	* Title
	* Classification
	* People
	* primaryMedia
	* Depth
	* displayDate
	* Width
	* Id
	* Dimensions

* Collections:  This is an array that contains 11 collections with the following information per each collection. 

	* Image
	* Folder
	* Name
	* Id
	* CollectionLink

The 11 collections are Art of Africa, Art of Asia, Art of Central and South America, Art of Egypt, Art of Europe, Art of North America, Art of the Ancient Americas, Art of the Ancient Mediterranean, Art of the Caribbean, Art of the Native Americas, Art of the Pacific Islands.

* Collection: Each collection has an array of object. Each object has this information:

	* primaryMaker
	* primaryMedia
	* displayDate
	* Invno
	* Id
	* title

We also got access to the server that Professor Clay asked. We connected to this server through Cyberduck with our UM credentials and we were able to upload our html file trying to connect to the API without success. We had a CORS error when trying to get the data and we couldn’t figure out how to solve this error.

# Week 6
Today we presented a rough prototype of the design and possible interactions as well as challenges. While the prototype was based on targeting a large tabletop touchscreen, we also kept in mind that the interactions could possibly occur on an iPad as well (*Note: the museum has iPads that are provided to visitors*).

![](muKD-EuclZ-BwFJ-lYreO9Ih0_iZEjHVWu27gEpsdz3-2Ll-XNOb9mkfY52T5MxtQiOti6c6GNl4wlk8cdKTZDLrtRo-igPA_84QI5SY72uRixnp8DUSnrfWgui5ngOUPIRApDgL.png)

Link to prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/h6UUwDxhpb5h5QcfZbLvA7/LOWE-Data-Viz-Wireframe?node-id=72%3A1392&scaling=min-zoom

**Challenges**
For this version, we have a few things we need to iron out as we move forward regarding interactions given that this could be presented on a very large screen.

**Questions to explore:**
What does that look like on various screen sizes?
For an infinite canvas how does this impact the current layout structure (main content containers)?
How and will interactions differ depending on screen sizes?

**Feedback from Clay and the class**
**Interim color categorization**: We could potentially do a color categorization of images using Processing. Those steps involve using PHP to access the images and then use Processing to tag (?) the images. One of our established goals was to present the museum’s collection in different (exploratory) ways. Color is one way to explore.

**Artificial Intelligence**: One idea we’ve been exploring with regard to adding to the existing museum database is the use of machine learning to help do the manual work. A computer could be trained to classify images into categories such as mood, gender, color, shapes within an object, iconography, etc. 

**Next steps:**
* Download data into a csv file so we can explore the data and test out some visualizations
* Tweak the existing prototype some more
* Deliver a rough structure to create a working frame for the web pages
* Refine a user flow

**API Connection:**
This week we finally could connect to the eMuseum database. Professor Ewing helped us to addresses the CORS error. He believed that it was being caused due to the javascript still being called from the client PC, so he wrote a PHP script that pulls the object collection, then creates a bigger array of each into a JSON file. That should be accessible through our index.html file without a CORS error.

`object_collection.php`

![](ZJXW8EweKo7648rXANZBBf5OybDA5sobmd7xzXlSc-hbV4nE_dH4Rs-OTA83KjZLHGUtvs3GKNp77plt1Puo-hXnkbOzUw4mrthRjF9jzaynHCu6-wPwwTYA00AmNbtmhoJ87fL-.png)

During the workshop in class, after a few trials, we could connect our html script that uses the PHP script to obtain the data from the eMuseum. 

`get.html`

![](qa92b4VVc8f1KmGsOlPejB_q6Rgd6SUobGSWxP4NgEkuEkNXOuqQgEGQ34Z4niRoNNU8yp0MJ6fh3g1JW3DH0dtCGJX2X6qn8Nih1Fix6KfYp-Ui0a7ozKoSTWwbKiVPQ3d7jSVU.png)

We also realized that the json returns arrays with a maximum of 100 objects. This is an issue that we will need to address.
